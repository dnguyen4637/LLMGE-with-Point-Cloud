You have gained international recognition for your work in artificial intelligence research and are now being asked to apply your expertise to a dormant project. Our goal is to enhance the performance of the following code segment by fine-tuning its default settings or hyperparameters:

Below is the current code:
=======
python
def calculate_mean(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

def calculate_standard_deviation(numbers):
    mean = calculate_mean(numbers)
    variance = sum((x - mean)**2 for x in numbers) / len(numbers)
    return variance ** 0.5

def preprocess_data(dataset):
    processed_data = []
    for row in dataset:
        processed_row = [float(x) for x in row]
        processed_data.append(processed_row)
    return processed_data

def train_model(dataset):
    preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(dataset)
    # Model training logic goes here

def predict(input):
    # Prediction logic goes here
