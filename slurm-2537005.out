Example of the modified code: 
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_average(numbers)) 
```
Example of the initial code:
```python
 
```

Q1: Very concisely, let's explore step by step how modifying this code segment enhanced its scoring metrics performance.
Q2: With the insights from Q1 in mind, can we apply the same principles in a concise manner to update the code snippet below, ensuring the input and output tensor sizes remain unchanged?

Snippet to be augmented:
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_average(numbers)) 
```

 about how modifying the given code segment improved its scoring metrics performance.

Step 1: Importing necessary libraries
The first line imports the NumPy library, which is used for numerical computations in Python. This library provides various functions that make it easier to perform mathematical operations on arrays and matrices.

Step 2: Defining the function
The next few lines define a function called `calculate_average`, which takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns their average value. The function calculates the average by summing up all the elements in the list using the `sum` function and dividing the result by the length of the list using the `len` function.

Step 3: Calling the function
Finally, the function is called with a list of five integers as its argument, and the resulting average value is printed to the console.

To enhance the performance of this code segment, we can modify it to use vectorized operations instead of looping through each element in the list. This will improve the efficiency of the code and reduce the time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

Here's the updated code segment:
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return np.mean(numbers)

numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(calculate_average(numbers))
```
In this version of the code, we replace the built-in `sum` and `len` functions with the `np.mean` function from the NumPy library. This function calculates the mean of the elements in an array or a list. We also convert the input list to a NumPy array using the `np.array` function. This allows us to take advantage of NumPy's efficient array operations and avoid looping through each element in the list.

A2: To update the code snippet below while keeping the input and output tensor sizes unchanged, we can modify it as follows:

Initial code snippet:
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(calculate_average(numbers))
```
Updated code snippet:
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return np.mean(numbers)

numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(calculate_average(numbers))
```
In this updated version of the code, we replace the `sum` and `len` functions with the `np.mean` function from the NumPy library. This function calculates the mean of the elements in an array or a list. By converting the input list to a NumPy array using the `np.array` function, we can take advantage of NumPy's efficient array operations and avoid looping through each element in the list. This ensures that the input and output tensor sizes remain unchanged.
