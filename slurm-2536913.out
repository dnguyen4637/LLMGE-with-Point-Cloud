Code Snippet 1
```python

    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_average(numbers)) 
```
Code Snippet 2
```python

Q: How can the model's predictive metrics be enhanced by amalgamating elements from these two code snippet alternatives?

1. Retain original class names.
2. Format the code in Markdown.
3. Exclude setup/demonstration code.
4. Retain original tensor input/output sizes.
5. Provide full code.
6. Must function with default settings.

 to enhance the model's predictive metrics by combining elements from both code snippets.

First, we should follow the best practices for writing clean and readable code. This includes formatting the code using Markdown, excluding any unnecessary setup or demonstration code, retaining the original tensor input/output sizes, and ensuring that the provided code is complete and functions correctly with default settings.

In terms of combining elements from both code snippets, there are no obvious similarities or differences between them that would suggest a way to combine them directly. However, one potential approach could be to modify the `calculate_average` function to work with tensors instead of lists. Here's an example of how this might look:

Code Snippet 3
```python
import numpy as np
import torch

def calculate_average(tensor):
    return tensor.sum() / tensor.numel()

numbers = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(calculate_average(numbers))
```
This modified `calculate_average` function takes a PyTorch tensor as input and calculates its average value. By doing so, we can use this function to calculate the average value of any tensor, including those outputted by our machine learning models.

To further improve the model's predictive metrics, we could consider techniques such as data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, or transfer learning. These techniques can help to increase the model's accuracy, generalization ability, and robustness to noise or outliers. Additionally, we could consider using more advanced machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks or ensemble methods, which have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on many complex tasks.
