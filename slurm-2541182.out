Example of the modified code: 
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_average(numbers)) 
```
Example of the initial code:
```python
 
```

Q1: Very concisely, let's explore step by step how modifying this code segment enhanced its scoring metrics performance.
Q2: With the insights from Q1 in mind, can we apply the same principles in a concise manner to update the code snippet below, ensuring the input and output tensor sizes remain unchanged?

Snippet to be augmented:
```python
class get_loss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(get_loss, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, pred, target, trans_feat):
        total_loss = F.nll_loss(pred, target)

        return total_loss 
```

 about how modifying the given code segment improved its scoring metrics performance.

The original code calculates only the negative log-likelihood loss (NLLLoss) between the predicted and target tensors. However, it does not consider any additional information that might be available, such as transformation features (trans\_feat).

To enhance the model's performance, we added an extra term to the loss function based on the transformation features. This addition allows the model to learn better representations by considering both the prediction accuracy and the transformation features.

Here is the updated version of the code:
```python
import torch.nn.functional as F

class GetLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(GetLoss, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, pred, target, trans_feat):
        total_loss = F.nll_loss(pred, target) + F.mse_loss(trans_feat, torch.zeros_like(trans_feat))

        return total_loss
```
In this version, we added another term to the loss function using Mean Squared Error (MSELoss) between the transformation features and zeros. By doing so, we encourage the model to produce transformation features close to zero when possible, which may help improve the overall performance.

A2: To apply the same principles to the provided snippet, we need to modify the loss function to include an additional term based on the transformation features. Here's the updated version of the code:

```python
class GetLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(GetLoss, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, pred, target, trans_feat):
        total_loss = F.nll_loss(pred, target) + F.mse_loss(trans_feat, torch.zeros_like(trans_feat))

        return total_loss
```
This modification ensures that the input and output tensor sizes remain unchanged while adding an extra term to the loss function based on the transformation features. The new term encourages the model to generate transformation features closer to zero, potentially improving the overall performance.
