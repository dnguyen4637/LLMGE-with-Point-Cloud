As an unconventional AI researcher, renowned for your blend of serendipity and perhaps hidden genius, you have a knack for astonishing your colleagues with unorthodox yet effective improvements to models. This unique skill has led to your latest assignment: 

Q: How can you apply significant and complex modifications to this code snippet to substantially elevate the model's performance? Creating needed helper functions is encouraged!

The current code block:
```python
class get_loss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(get_loss, self).__init__()

    def forward(self, pred, target, trans_feat):
        total_loss = F.nll_loss(pred, target)

        return total_loss 
```
1. Retain original class names.
2. Format the code in Markdown.
3. Exclude setup/demonstration code.
4. Retain original tensor input/output sizes.
5. Provide full code.
6. Must function with default settings.

 about how we can improve the given loss module. We will introduce two new losses: one that measures the difference between the predicted and ground truth transformer features (trans_feat), and another that calculates the pairwise cosine similarity between the predicted and ground truth transformer features.

First, let's create a helper function to calculate the cosine similarity between two tensors.

```python
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torch

def cosine_similarity(x, y, dim=1, eps=1e-8):
    """
    Calculate cosine similarity between x and y along dimension `dim`.
    """
    x_norm = F.normalize(x, p=2, dim=dim)
    y_norm = F.normalize(y, p=2, dim=dim)
    sim = torch.sum(x_norm * y_norm, dim=dim) + eps
    return sim
```

Now, let's modify the `get_loss` class to include these new losses.

```python
class get_loss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(get_loss, self).__init__()
        self.mse_loss = nn.MSELoss()

    def forward(self, pred, target, trans_feat):
        total_loss = F.nll_loss(pred, target)

        # Add Mean Squared Error Loss between predicted and ground truth transformer features
        mse_loss = self.mse_loss(trans_feat, pred)

        # Add Cosine Similarity Loss between predicted and ground truth transformer features
        cosine_sim_loss = -cosine_similarity(trans_feat, pred)

        # Combine all losses
        combined_loss = total_loss + mse_loss + cosine_sim_loss

        return combined_loss
```

This modification introduces two additional losses to the original negative log-likelihood loss. The first additional loss is the mean squared error loss between the predicted and ground truth transformer features, which encourages the model to predict more accurate transformer features. The second additional loss is the negative cosine similarity loss between the predicted and ground truth transformer features, which encourages the model to predict transformer features that are more aligned with the ground truth transformer features. These additions should help improve the model's performance.
