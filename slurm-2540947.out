Example of the modified code: 
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_average(numbers)) 
```
Example of the initial code:
```python
 
```

Q1: Very concisely, let's explore step by step how modifying this code segment enhanced its scoring metrics performance.
Q2: With the insights from Q1 in mind, can we apply the same principles in a concise manner to update the code snippet below, ensuring the input and output tensor sizes remain unchanged?

Snippet to be augmented:
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_average(numbers)) 
```

 about how the given code was modified to enhance its scoring metrics performance.

Step 1: The original code calculates the average of a list of numbers using the `sum()` function to add up all the elements in the list and then dividing by the length of the list. However, this method does not account for potential outliers or skewed data distributions that could negatively impact the accuracy of the calculated average.

Step 2: To address this issue, the modified code uses the `numpy` library instead of built-in Python functions to perform the calculation. This allows for more efficient and accurate calculations on large datasets.

Step 3: Specifically, the `np.mean()` function is used to calculate the mean value of the input array. This function takes into account any potential outliers or skewed data distributions and provides a more robust measure of central tendency than simply dividing the sum of the elements by the number of elements.

Step 4: Additionally, the `np.array()` function is used to convert the input list into a NumPy array before passing it to the `np.mean()` function. This ensures that the input tensor has the correct size and format required for the calculation.

Step 5: Finally, the result is printed to the console using the `print()` function.

A2: Yes, we can apply the same principles to update the given code snippet as follows:

First, import the necessary libraries:
```python
import numpy as np
```
Next, define the function to calculate the average using NumPy:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    return np.mean(numbers)
```
Then, create an example input list and convert it to a NumPy array:
```python
numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```
Finally, call the function and print the result:
```python
result = calculate_average(numbers)
print(result)
```
Putting it all together, the updated code snippet would look like this:
```python
import numpy as np

def calculate_average(numbers):
    return np.mean(numbers)

numbers = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result = calculate_average(numbers)
print(result)
```
This updated code snippet uses NumPy to efficiently and accurately calculate the mean value of the input array, taking into account any potential outliers or skewed data distributions. It also ensures that the input tensor has the correct size and format required for the calculation.
